FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python. It is based on standard Python type hints and is designed to create RESTful APIs with a focus on performance and ease of use. FastAPI is known for its speed and the automatic generation of interactive documentation using tools like Swagger UI and ReDoc.

Here are some key features of FastAPI:

Fast and Efficient: It is one of the fastest frameworks for building APIs due to asynchronous support. It runs on top of Starlette and Pydantic, which provide excellent performance.

Type Hinting: FastAPI uses Python's standard type hints to define the data types of parameters and responses, helping with automatic validation, serialization, and documentation generation.

Automatic Documentation: FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc.

Asynchronous Programming: It supports asynchronous programming with async and await keywords to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
Easy to Use: FastAPI makes creating endpoints and handling requests straightforward with minimal code.
Data Validation: Pydantic models are used for automatic data validation and serialization.
Security: It includes tools for handling security, authentication, and authorization.
